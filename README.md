# BreakTime

This simple Google Chrome extension allows the user to select a duration of time for break and get reminded when the break is over.

## How It Works
The user starts their break by selecting a time in the popup menu.

</p>


Then, the user will be reminded with a notification when their break is over.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="100" src="images/notification.png">
</p>

The user can click `Close` or ignore the notification for it to disappear. The user can also choose to extend their break by clicking `More` and then `Extend break`.
